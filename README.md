# Community-Hardship-and-Opportunity-in-Chicago
Created a Power BI dashboard to explore community hardship and opportunity in Chicago. Analyzed metrics like poverty, education, housing, and health across neighborhoods. Used DAX and geospatial visuals to highlight disparities, support policy decisions, and identify areas for targeted community development.
